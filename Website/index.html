    <h4>Why I Joined Code Nation:</h4>
    <p>I first got the bug for coding when I was at University studying.  But I then got onto a good graduate scheme doing something completely different and coding fell by the wayside!  I changed jobs in early 2020 and then during the pandemic I got made redundant. This gave me a bit of time to think about what I would really like to make a career in, and so here I am! For me coding balances the opportunity to be creative with my logical and detail oriented sides making it an interesting and enjoyable career opportunity.</p>
